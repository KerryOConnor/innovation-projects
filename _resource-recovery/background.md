Everybody likes to trash talk. Actually, this is recycling talk. In early 2016, Austin's Design, Technology, and Innovation (DTI) Fellows joined forces with Austin Resource Recovery (ARR) to make an impact on Austin's Zero Waste goal through a 6 month partnership. The DTI Fellowship supplied full-time Fellows with expertise in research, design, development, and project management. ARR supplied subject matter experts and funding. September 2016 marks the official start of the project.

Before jumping to solutions, the first step is to learn about the perspectives, knowledge, and behaviors of Austin residents regarding recycling. What makes Austin residents tick is not the same for residents in Singapore, San Francisco, or even San Antonio. The needs of Austin's residents and neighborhoods is the guiding North Star for developing approaches to recycling that caters to them.
