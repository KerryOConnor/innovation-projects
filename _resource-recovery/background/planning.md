## Scope & Timeline

![image of planning](/uploads/photo.jpg)

#### Scope
This is a 6 month project with two main phases: (1) Research, Discovery, and Synthesis and (2) Concepting, Prototyping and Testing. The Fellows are responsible for planning the project, executing the project work, and delivering appropriate deliverables after each phase to Austin Resource Recovery. In addition to delivering actionable insights and solutions, the Fellows will expose and teach human-centered design tools and techniques to Austin Resource Recovery staff and partners.

More details on the scope can be found in the [partnership agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTiYiE4ddg0zBomGuqdg3_ic13ugebiaFAdxZibDB3k/edit?usp=sharing).

### Timeline

The project will run from September 2016 - Feb 2017.

## Project Phases

#### Research, Discovery, and Synthesis (3 months)
During this phase, the Core Team will met with stakeholders and partners to better understand the problem area. The team also conducted ride-alongs with operators to understand how the city serves it's residents. The bulk of the field work was conducting 40 to 50 interviews with individual residents, families, and property managers across the city to understand how people currently think and act around recycling and composting. As we talked to different types of residents and property managers, we identifed patterns and insights and developed behavioral personas to help segment different types of behaviors, perspectives, and living situations. We documented and shared our findings with the larger network of stakeholders, and began the concepting and prototyping stage with a deep understanding or real-world behavior.

Deliverables:

* Research plan
* Recruiting strategy
* Interview protocols
* Review of existing print and digital resources
* Competitive Analysis
* Resident personas
* Research artifacts
* Insights document and videos
* Insights share-out sessions

#### Concepting, Prototyping, and Testing (3 months)

During this stage, we’ll design and test possible solutions to support Austin’s zero waste goals. Across digital and non-digital channels, we’ll develop options based on the research gathered during the Discovery stage and test them in the real world with different types of residents and property managers. We’ll create quick learning loops of designing, testing, iterating, and testing again, allowing us to understand which solutions will work best for different personas, demographics, neighborhoods, and housing types.

Deliverables will include:

* Design and testing plan
* Extensive list of concepts generated
* Testing protocols
* Measurements and observations of behaviors after testing possible solutions
* Recommendations for possible solutions based on research and testing
* Recommendations for improvements to existing print and digital resources
* Recommendations share-out sessions

## Teaching Human-Centered Design

Austin Resource Recovery staff and other city partners involved in the project will learn new research, concepting, prototyping, and evaluation skills that can be used on a smaller scale to test messaging and materials on future projects.
